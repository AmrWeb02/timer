# Timer application built with React JS and Vite
https://amrweb02.github.io/timer/

This timer app includes features like start, pause, reset, and leap buttons. The Leap button captures the current time and adds it to a list. 

The project makes use of React hooks such as useRef and useState for efficient state management, and itâ€™s designed with clean, modular code.
